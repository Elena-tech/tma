    <h2>39 Steps Coffee Haus</h2>
    <img src="images/place.png" alt="place"> 
    <h6> Soho </h6>
    <p>
    This corner coffee shop in the heart of Soho takes its caffeine very seriously. If it’s coffee-based, you’ll find it here: standard flat whites, lattes and cortados, then more offbeat options including ‘coffee tonics’ (espresso with tonic), iced americanos and housemade thick cold coffee freakshakes. There’s food too, but truthfully, the coffee is what 39 Steps is all about.

    <h2>Antipode</h2>
    <img src="images/place.png" alt="place"> 
    <h6> Hammersmith </h6>
    <p>
    On a mission to bring some Melbourne magic to the streets of Hammersmith, this cool Antipodean café brews up some terrific stuff. They use Square Mile’s Red Brick beans for espresso and serve inventive brunch-style food – their kimchi and cheddar toastie is a best-seller. Just add some ace Aussie craft beers.

    <h2>Black Cab Coffee Co.</h2>
    <img src="images/place.png" alt="place"> 
    <h6> Patmore Estate </h6>
    <p>
    Formerly a pop-up espresso bar in a converted taxi, this now-permanent café by the Thames has a coffee roaster in its dining area constantly pumping out beans. The menu offers much more than java, though – try the spicy iced chai (you can add a shot of vodka, if you like). There’s a proper brunch menu, too.

  <h2>Espresso Room</h2>
  <img src="images/place.png" alt="place"> 
  <h6> Covent garden </h6>
  <p>
  Capacity doesn’t make it far into double digits at this small but perfectly formed shrine to straight caffeine. Choice may be minimal too (espresso-based coffees, soup, a few sandwiches and cakes), but I love Bloomsbury’s ER – especially when I can sit outside in fine weather. Smiling staff show off their technical skills with modesty. </p>
